# Black Jack 
Black Jack is a terminal game , with run in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Blackjack is traditionally a gambling game, now there's an alternative way to play!
Blackjack is an exciting card game that can draw you in with its action and fun. Developed by players for many years, the game of blackjack is made up of a dealer, a player, and a deck of cards. The objective is to get as close to 21 (on any point sooner than twenty-one) without going over. This can be achieved by hitting cards, standing on soft 17s, standing on hard 17s, or splitting pairs. Blackjack is a game that requires skill and knowledge about how other players are interpreting their hands to make an optimal play. This script will let you simulate blackjack games at home on your computer.
